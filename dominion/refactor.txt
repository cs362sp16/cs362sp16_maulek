Assignment 1

Noted Changes:

In this assignment we were asked to pick at least 5 cards and change them so that they
were implemented in their own functions rather than within the switch statement.
I figured it may be helpful over all to move all implementation of the cards into their own functions.
So I did, I then placed their implementations into a file called "cards.h" and #included them into
dominion.c.
