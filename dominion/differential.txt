For this assignment I tested my testdominion.c code against Rhea Mae's dominion.c code.
My test failed when I changed the seed and other times it didnt. Code coverage was
95.65% which mostly meant that it didn't cover some if statements within my code which
made sense. This is not optimal in deciding who's dominion.c code is correct because
my tests just plays the game and doesn't nessisarily check for correct outputs which requires
a lot more thought process in what the outputs should be with very limited test
cases.
